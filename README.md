# Before my first trip to London, I wanted to explore the public transportation network

I used London Public Transport dataset (in BigQuery) and wrote three SQL queries to answer the following questions:

1. What are the most popular transport types, measured by the total number of journeys?
   (spoiler alert --> most Londoners take the Bus (67% more often than the Tube), followed by the Underground)

2. Which five months and years were the most popular for the cable car system that crosses the River Thames (called 'Emirates Airline' or the 'IFS Cloud Cable Car')
  (spoiler alert --> 2012 was the most popular year, likely due to the London Olympics. It was also fun to discover that May is the busiest month, probably thanks to a nicer weather!)

3. Find the five years with the lowest volume of Underground & DLR journeys.
   (spoiler alert --> 2020 had the lowest trips, no surprise there, given COVID-19 and the rise of remote work)
